# Web Authentication Demo

This is a demonstration of implementing the Web Authentication API using Node.js.

You can play around with a running instance here: https://rowno-web-authentication-demo.herokuapp.com

## Development

Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the database, run `yarn seed` initialise the database and then run `yarn dev` to start the site in development mode.

To lint the files and test that the site builds, run `yarn lint` and `yarn build` (this will also check that the TypeScript is valid).

To start the site in production mode, run `yarn build` and then `yarn start`.
